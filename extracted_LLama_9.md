|Time deposit early uplift handling fee|We may, at our discretion, allow uplift of time deposit before maturity. Time deposit interest accrued will not be paid and handling fee, with calculation stated below, will apply: Time Deposit Principal x (HSBCâ€™s Interbank Offered Rate - Time Deposit Interest Rate) x Number of Days due to Maturity / Total Number of Days in a Year (minimum HK$200)| | | | | | | | | | |

Note: After imposing the early uplift handling fee, the principal amount received may be less than the original time deposit placement amount.

1. Applicable to all types of cheques including paper cheque and e-Cheque.
2. If you issue a cheque which, if honoured by us, would either cause your account to go overdrawn or over an existing overdraft limit, we will treat this as your ad-hoc request for an unauthorised overdraft. We may agree to your request and provide you with an overdraft.
3. This charge is made for the amount of a single cheque issued and presented in Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) exceeds RMB80,000.
4. If you issue a cheque which contains an error or if your cheque is not issued in accordance with our requirements, we will treat this as your informal request for special service. We may refuse your request, return the cheque to you and charge, without prior notice, a handling fee for considering your request on each occasion.
5. If you issue a cheque from your RMB Current Account which, if honoured by us, would either cause your account to go overdrawn, you will need to request for fund transfer from RMB Savings Account to RMB Current Account. If you do not make a request for fund transfer, we will treat this as your informal request for fund transfer and carry out the fund transfer. In either case, we may charge, without prior notice, a handling fee for considering your request.
