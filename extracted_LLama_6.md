1 This standard concessionary charge applies to the first time and normal data access request. In other cases, the Bank reserves the right to charge the actual commercial cost incurred without applying a cap to the charge. In any case, the Bank will inform the data requestor individually the actual handling charge and will only process the request upon receiving the requestor’s acceptance.

2 If you ask us to set up a standing instruction to pay from your account, which if executed by us, would cause your account to go overdrawn or over an existing overdraft limit, we will treat this as your ad-hoc request for an unauthorized overdraft. We may agree to your request and provide you with an overdraft. The amount of the unauthorized overdraft will be subject to our prevailing interest rate calculated on a daily basis. We will also charge a handling charge for the unauthorized overdraft on each occasion. Alternatively, we may refuse your request and your instruction.
