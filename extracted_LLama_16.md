If you pay the statement balance in full on or before the payment due date, you will enjoy free interest on the statement balance. If you fail to do so, we may charge, without prior notice, a finance charge which is the interest on (a) the unpaid statement balance from the statement date immediately preceding the said statement due date until payment in full and (b) the amount of each new transaction posted since such statement date until payment in full. The finance charge will accrue daily and be calculated at the interest rate of 2.65% per month (equivalent to the APRs listed below).

# Fees Relating to Foreign Currency Transaction

*The fee relating to foreign currency transactions applicable for HK dollar personal credit cards and USD Visa Gold Card is inclusive of the transaction fee of 1% charged by Visa/Mastercard to the Bank.

# Footnotes

1. This charge also applies to non-HSBC customers.
2. The APR is calculated based on a set of assumptions as set out in the relevant guidelines as referred to in the Code of Banking Practice and the actual APR applied to your card account may be different. US dollar Visa Gold Card requires payment of the statement balance in full and the APR (calculated by assuming only 1% of the current balance plus the total fees and charges currently billed to the card statement are settled each month) is for reference only.
3. If you fail to make the minimum payment in full before the due date, we may charge, without prior notice, a late charge in addition to finance charge.
4. If your statement balance (excluding all fees and charges currently billed to your card account) exceeds the existing credit limit on your card, we will treat this as your informal request for raising your credit limit. We may agree to your request and charge, without prior notice, a handling fee for considering and agreeing to your request.
5. If you present a cheque drawn on, or make an autoPay payment from, banks other than HSBC for the purpose of credit card repayment, and the cheque or payment is subsequently returned or rejected, we will treat this as your informal request for special handling services and may charge, without prior notice, a handling fee for such service.
