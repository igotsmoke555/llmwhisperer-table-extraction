Note: The above service charges (except the cancellation fee and the charge for custody of non-discharged deeds after full loan repayment) will not be applicable to Government Housing Scheme*.

1 Cancellation fee is only applicable for applications received on or after 1 August 2015. For applications received before 1 August 2015, application fee charging at 0.15% of the loan amount upon acceptance will apply instead. For applications received on or after 1 November 2017, the cancellation fee will be subject to a minimum of HK$5,000. Effective 1 Nov 2023 Government Housing Scheme* applications are also subject to cancellation fee.

2 If you fail to make payment in full when due (including where there are insufficient funds in the repayment account), we may charge, without prior notice, a late charge in addition to interest on the overdue repayment(s).

3 These charges are subject to approval by the Bank. If your mortgage loan facility letter sets out a different amount of prepayment charges from above, your facility letter shall prevail. You may also be required to return the whole or part of any cash incentives you received from the Bank.
