                 5 If you present a cheque drawn on, or make an autoPay payment from, banks other than HSBC for the purpose of credit card repayment, and the cheque or payment is subsequently returned or rejected, we will treat this as your informal request for special handling services and may charge, without prior notice, a handling fee for such service.
